	"What do we want to achieve with the offer?": "Vinnova wants to contribute to more sustainable food systems through increased collaboration between Swedish and international actors. Proposal must address one of the following thematic areas: 1. The path towards sustainable and resilient and resilient food systems This theme focuses on developing new ways of organizing and improving our food systems using, for example, market solutions, new business models, policy measures and experimental methods. The goal is to make the food system more sustainable from all three dimensions of sustainability, such as economic profitability, environmental considerations and the well-being of society. Funded project must work in particular to strengthen cooperation and network building between different actors in the food system and the food sector in order to adopt new, innovative solutions that can transform the sector. 2. Novel Foods – Fostering innovations in food design, processing and distribution through reorientation of supply and demand Diversification of food supply and demand has potential to address several challenges. For example, unhealthy eating habits, environmental and climate impacts and dependence on imports of food and inputs. This theme aims to create new methods for conceiving, designing, manufacturing and distributing new types of food. Foods based on various raw materials such as plants, legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, algae, edible fungi, microorganisms and cell cultures. In this area, local and traditional foods that have been forgotten, called 'forgotten foods', but which can enrich our diet with nutritional and ecological benefits, can also be explored. 3. Strengthen sustainable food choices – Enabling food environments and dietary changes Changing to more sustainable food choices requires changing norms, attitudes and habits. It is important to understand how food environments affect us. Food environments are about the contexts that influence our choices when we buy and consume food, as well as about the factors that facilitate or prevent us from choosing sustainable eating habits. This theme focuses on overcoming obstacles to choosing more sustainable eating habits. The goal is to make it easier for consumers to make informed, sustainable food choices. By redesigning both digital and physical places where food is sold and consumed, people's eating habits can be influenced to become safer, more nutritious, environmentally friendly, affordable, accessible, fair, culturally accepted and good. Please note that this is only an extract from the thematic descriptions and only gives an indication of what is included in the call for proposals. More detailed descriptions and examples can be found in the international the call text. To the extent that the descriptions differ, it is the international the call text that applies. Regardless of the thematic area, the following applies to all applications: Focus on post-harvest challenges. From raw materials to eating habits. Please note that primary production such as cultivation of raw materials including seafood, agricultural production and other specific aspects related to this are not the focus of this the call for proposals. The call for proposals also does not focus on nutrition- and lifestyle-related diseases. Adopting a System Perspective, which refers to all parts such as environment, people, inputs, processes, infrastructure, power relations, markets, trade. Also activities and operations related to production, processing, distribution, marketing, preparation and consumption of food as well as other food services and waste management and recycling. A systems approach also takes into account the interaction between these parts. The call for proposals also has four additional guiding principles that are also part of the evaluation of the applications: Transformative perspective, where the projects must be solution- and effect-oriented. An 'impact plan' that includes a problem and context analysis must be included. Inter- and transdisciplinarity where applicant must bring together relevant disciplines for the project, for example life science with social science and humanities. Multi-actor collaboration to engage actors from different sectors and decision-making levels in all parts of the research and innovation process, i.e. design, implementation and follow-up. Quadruple helix collaborations are encouraged. All three dimensions of sustainability should be considered but do not need to be addressed to the same extent. It should be clearly stated how the project contributes to conversion to sustainable food systems. It is important that applicant reads the full description of the call's aim, guiding principles and thematic areas in the international the call text. Contribute to a sustainable system transition Vinnova is tasked with promoting sustainable growth and system change. In order to carry out sustainable system change, we have chosen to start from the UN's global sustainability goals, defined in Agenda 2030. There, Vinnova prioritizes two perspectives in particular: gender equality and climate change. In this the call for proposals assessment of applications takes place through the secretariat, the international program office for FutureFoodS. Vinnova does not make its own assessment of these perspectives. Vinnova can, however, request information about how your project contributes to these perspectives for follow-up purposes. It can be about the following aspects: if women and men participate equally in the project, share in the contribution and have influence and power over the project how well the project analyzes and takes a position on whether there are gender or gender aspects that are relevant to the project's problem formulation, solutions and effects how well the project contributes to climate change with a focus on opportunities and challenges within the food system. Equal innovation - what it means for you who seek funding from us Agenda 2030 as a driving force for innovation",
	"Who are we targeting?": "Companies, universities, research institutes, authorities as well as private and public organizations can receive funding from Swedish financiers in this call for proposals. Funding can only be paid out to legal entities with a Swedish corporate identity number. Funding is only given to Swedish actors who apply as part of an international consortium according to the eligibility requirements set in the international the call text. Please note that participating countries and funders may have different rules for who can apply for funding.

There you will also find contact information for the secretariat, the international program office for FutureFoodS, who can answer questions about formal eligibility requirements and the focus of the call.",
	"What do we finance?": "What costs can we finance? Our funding is covered by rules on state aid. The rules govern what kinds of costs we can finance. These are called eligible costs. In this the call for proposals these types of costs are eligible: Personnel costs: Salaries, social security contributions and other personnel costs Equipment, land and buildings: Instruments, equipment and rent for premises other than regular business premises Consulting and license costs: Consulting services, knowledge and patents purchased or used under license from an external actor. Consulting costs should not exceed 10-20 percent of a project's budget. Other direct costs: For example materials, stock items and travel necessary to carry out the project Indirect costs (overhead): Costs that are not incurred as an immediate consequence of but can be related to the project, for example regular premises and cleaning. Indirect costs may constitute a maximum of 30 percent of personnel costs. For more detailed information on which costs we can finance, see Instructions for eligible costs. Which eligibility requirements apply to costs we finance? For a cost to be eligible for support, it must be necessary for the activities of the project. Project costs must also be properly accounted for and reported separately from the organization's other costs. An organization may also not take up someone else's costs as its own. For more detailed information on which eligibility requirements, limitations and exceptions apply, see Instructions for eligible costs Costs must be stated in euros in proposal to the secretariat. When proposal is then submitted to Vinnova or Formas, costs must be stated in Swedish kronor. Use the exchange rate, euros to Swedish kronor, from the date the call for proposals closed for proposal in stage one. The exchange rate to be used must come from Sveriges Riksbank",
	"How much funding do we provide?": "The rules on state aid also govern what proportion of the costs we can finance. This is determined individually for each actor. We therefore distinguish between how much funding the project can receive, and how much each participating actor can receive. How much funding can the project get? The Swedish the actors in a project can together apply for a maximum of 300,000 euros in funding. If a Swedish actor acts as coordinator for the entire transnational consortium, the project can apply for up to 450,000 euros in funding for Swedish actors. In total, Vinnova and Formas have set aside 2.7 million euros for Swedish actors in this call for proposals. The project's total budget and funding is dependent on the number of project parties, who these parties are and their national guidelines. In order to achieve balanced consortia, there is a rule regarding the maximum total work input, the number of person-months, for all parties from one and the same country. It must not exceed 60 percent of the total work input (number of person-months) for all parties in all countries. See the international the call text for all details and formal eligibility requirements. How much funding can a participant receive? How much funding each participating participant can receive mainly depends on: which activities the party will carry out in the project party size and activities. Research and development – Article 25 In this the call for proposals we provide support for basic research, industrial research and experimental development. Basic research is experimental or theoretical work that primarily aims to acquire new knowledge about the fundamental causes of phenomena and observable facts. Basic research is not aimed at any direct commercial application or use. Industrial research can be simply described as seeking new knowledge through planned research or critical analysis in order to develop or significantly improve products, processes or services. Experimental development lineg can be simply described as combining, shaping and using existing knowledge to produce new or improved products, processes or services. For full definition, see Support bases and support levels for funding What percentage of the costs can we finance? The organization's size and type of activity determine what percentage of the costs we can finance, i.e. the maximum level of support. Table coming soon Bonus grounds If the project is covered by one of these bonus bases, we can finance a higher percentage of the costs according to the table: Actual cooperation: Some level of cooperation between small and large companies, between companies in two different European countries or between research organizations and companies Dissemination of results: Extensive dissemination through, for example, conferences or open databases. Other bonus basis For full information on these bonus bases, see Support bases and support levels for funding We grant funding in accordance with Article 25 of the European Commission's General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER). Support for process innovation and organizational innovation - Article 29 In this the call for proposals we finance the introduction of new methods through so-called process innovation or organizational innovation. Process innovation can be simply described as introducing a new or significantly better method of production or delivery. The method may involve new technology, equipment or software, or new digital solutions. Organizational innovation can be simply described as introducing a new method for organizing a company or a workplace. The method may involve new digital technology or new digital solutions. For full definitions of these terms, see Support bases and support levels for funding For small and medium-sized companies, we can finance a maximum of 50 percent of each project party's eligible costs. For larger companies, we can finance up to 15 percent of eligible costs. It assumes that: the company cooperates with a small or medium-sized company the smaller company finances at least 30 percent of the total project costs. We grant funding in accordance with Article 29 of the European Commission's General Block Exemption Regulation (GBER). De minimis support ( support of minor importance) In this the call for proposals we can also provide de minimis support, also called support of minor importance. We can finance up to 100 percent of a project party's costs. An organization can receive a maximum of 300,000 euros over a three-year period in this form of support, regardless of funder and project. This means that if the same organization received support of less importance in other project from other funders before, it affects how big the support can be in this the call for proposals. Submit a certificate of de-minimum support when you submit proposal to Vinnova. It is required for us to be able to grant this support. Certificates of de minimis support can be found on this page We grant funding in accordance with the EU Commission Regulation (2023/2831) on support of minor importance. Not state aid In this the call for proposals we also provide support to organizations that do not conduct economic activities. This means that they do not offer a service or product in a market. This usually includes universities and university colleges, research institutes and other organizations. We can finance up to 100 percent of such an organization's costs. How do you determine whether an organization carries out economic activities? An organization that offers any kind of service or product on a market is considered to be conducting economic activities and cannot be granted this form of support. It does not matter how the organization is financed, whether it is public or private, or whether it has a profit motive. It also does not matter what legal form the business takes. For example, if it is a limited company, a trading company, an economic association, a non-profit association or a foundation. If you are unsure whether an organization in your project carries out financial activities, contact call manager. However, the organization itself is responsible for assessing whether it carries out economic activities.",
