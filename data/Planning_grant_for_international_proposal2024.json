When hiring external expertise, it is important to describe their competence and previous experience in the field. Development of the scientific or technical basis for the project by, for example, carrying out pilot or 'proof of concept' studies. It is important to explain why this is required for a successful proposal or if the international the call for proposals specifically requests this. Activities to strengthen the business case, including conducting IPR analyses, user interviews or developing an initial business plan. It is important to justify why these measures are needed for a successful proposal or if the international the call for proposals specifically requires them.

Main project that focuses solely on basic research. Eligible costs Our funding takes place through funding.

Please note that the maximum permitted minor support is EUR 300,000 per recipient in the last three years. In order to calculate the maximum allowable support, all funding granted under the Ordinance on minor support must be added together. funding for other parts of the group must also be included in this calculation. However, if you have received support according to GBER, you should not count on this. In order to be granted this support, you therefore need to submit a certificate of de-minimum support. Non- state aid Funding is granted in accordance with § 5 regulation (2015:208) on support for research and development and innovation. The grant is granted as non- state aid, which organizations that do not conduct economic activities can be granted.
